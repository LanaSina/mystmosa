This paper reports on patterns exhibiting self-replication [](#fish-replication)!! with spontaneous, inheritable mutations(ref) and exponential genetic drift(ref) in [Neural Cellular Automata](doi:10.23915/distill.00023). Despite the models not being explicitly trained for mutation or inheritability, the descendant patterns exponentially drift away from ancestral patterns(ref), even when the automaton is deterministic(ref). While this is far from being the first instance of evolutionary dynamics in a cellular automaton, it is the first to do so by exploiting the power and convenience of Neural Cellular Automata, arguably increasing the space of variations and the opportunity for Open Ended Evolution.

Genetic coding and drift. A different run of the model in Fig.~\ref{fig:fish}, at training step 1500. (a)~MSE between the fish at generation 0 and its descendants. The descendants appear to be all equally different from the 0th generation, except for a jump at generation 82 where the fish develop a forked stripe that is inherited by successive generations. (b)~When calculating genetic drift, we find not a linear relationship as in~(a), but an exponential increase in MSE until generation 82, where this model stalls (not all models stall in 100 generations). (c)~The clear correlation indicates the emergence of a genetic code: DNA differences in the eggs are translated to phenotype differences in the developed organism, and big DNA mutations correspond (mostly) linearly to big phenotype differences.
